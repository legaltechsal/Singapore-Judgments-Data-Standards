# Singapore Judgments Data Standards

### Introduction

1	The Singapore Judgments Data Standard seeks to provide a common representation format and terminology for judgment data in Singapore. The standard describes the elements of Singapore judgments, to facilitate the understanding and adoption of judgments data in the legal technology industry. 

2	The standard is designed to support developers in creating products and services that include Singapore judgment data, or that integrate with LawNet Legal Research APIs. It does not propose an implementation design, and does not specify how judgments should be stored or transmitted in a computer system.

3	The data standard originates from SAL, the legal owner and publisher of the Singapore Law Reports, and the distributor for unreported Singapore judgments. SAL uses this standard on LawNet to publish decisions from Singapore tribunals, such as the Competition Commission and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.

### Guidelines For Use

4	The data standard is meant to be read together with the judgments data available through [LawNet Legal Research APIs](https://github.com/legaltechsal/LawNet-APIs) and the [SAL R&D Environment](https://github.com/legaltechsal/LawNetRD). These links provide guidelines for how the data can be used.
